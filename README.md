# Transperanto
Handbook for augmented, purified but perfectly legit Esperanto.

This is a tutorial for an extension of Esperanto that doesn't push for any change to 
the existing rules as established by Zamenhof and continued up to now in his name, but
rather as regards the general usage and habits taken by most users, by showing up new ways
allowed by the same set of rules.
